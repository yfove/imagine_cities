        <h2>
            Guided by our indicators and supported by systems thinking, we collect and share cities research from around
            the world in an effort to more fully understand the challenges and opportunities facing cities. We take a
            deeper dive into these topics through our webcast productions by inviting global leaders actively reshaping
            urban life.

                        has been organized into 20 city making categories to emphasize the importance of systems
                        thinking in meaningfully solving problems.

                    <p>
                        Our ability to solve complex urban problems comes from our ability to understand a range of
                        diverse perspectives. Using our research database, we curate a selection of perspectives about
                        the issues facing cities. Join our online event as we have conversations about the issues facing
                        cities to spark discussion and understanding while building connection.

                        demonstrating its impact, ,but a case could be made for the investment needed to make the

                        is done by developing a partnership between the City and local communities. The municipal
                        government creates a levy within the community to raise funds for local improvements within
                        a defined geographical area.

                        commercial or retail development etc. This way, the land can be permanently held for the
                        community instead of a private market. This system also works to ensure affordability for
                        home and business owners in the community.

                        is for them to move. These agreements aim to direct investments, such as the procurement of
                        goods and services, into the local community.

                        Community bonds is a tool a non-profit would use to finance their growth. The non-profit
                        would issue a series of bonds to its community who would purchase the bonds with an expected
                        rate of return. The non-profit would need a revenue model that would allow it to pay back
                        the initial investment plus the interest to the owner of the bond. This tool allows an
                        organization to raise the capital needed for growth. It can be used as part of a larger
                        funding model.
